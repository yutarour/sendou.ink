Leagues are a variety of sendou.ink tournaments where each division is a separate competition. Participants sign-up to one "entry tournament" then get divided into divisions by the organizers and one winner emerges per division.

## Creating a league

Note: leagues are not an open feature available for everyone and require some amount of manual admin work from Sendou.

1) Create tournament as normal on sendou.ink. This will be the tournament where users sign up to. Set registration closing time as you wish.
2) Link the bracket to sendou.
3) Once the registration closes from the admin tab download participant list as "league format" (.csv file).
4) Order the teams as you wish. Fill the "div" column with the desired division per participant.
5) Give sendou back the .csv file.
6) Division brackets will be generated. You get the chance to edit each as you wish before starting it. If you want to use the same maps for each division, just do them for one bracket then let Sendou know. There is an admin script that can be ran that copies them across all divisions.
7) (Optional): let Sendou know the start time of each bracket to control during which week which round of groups is played.
8) When everything looks good start divisions and play out the tournament as normal.
