/**
 * List of seasons with their respective start and end dates.
 *
 * Each season is represented as an object with the following properties:
 * - `nth`: The sequential number of the season (starting from 0).
 * - `starts`: The start date of the season as a `Date` object.
 * - `ends`: The end date of the season as a `Date` object.
 *
 * Note: The value is conditionally set based on the environment. In development mode,
 * the end date of the first season is set to a later date for testing purposes (ensures a season is always open).
 *
 * @example
 * console.log(Seasons.list[0].starts); // Logs the start date of the first season
