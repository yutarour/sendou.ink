<a href="https://sendou.ink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">sendou.ink</a> - a Splatoon platform with competitive focus

What differentiates sendou.ink from some other gaming platforms (e.g. tournament hosting platforms) is its 100% focus on Splatoon. This allows for more custom tailored experience around the game and the community. The wide range of distinct features make it possible to create seamless integrations between them further enriching the user experience beyond what external integrations would allow.

Another key objective is to bridge the gap between casual and competitive players. For example, features like a gear build simulator can appeal not only to competitive players but also to those who simply want to enhance their gameplay without participating in tournaments. This allows sendou.ink to be useful for a wider audience but also provides a window to the competitive side of things for those that might be interested.

## Running locally

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js v22](https://nodejs.org/en)

Optionally [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) can be convenient for managing multiple Node.js installs

### Commands

First verify you have Node.js and git installed:

```bash
node --version
git --version
```

You should see something like:

```
v22.13.0
git version 2.39.5 (Apple Git-154)
```
(if not then go back to "Prerequisites" and install what is missing)

Then there is a sequence of commands you need to run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sendou-ink/sendou.ink.git # Clones repository
cd sendou.ink # Change to the project's folder
npm install # Install dependencies
npm run dev # Setup the development environment and run the project
```

You should then be able to access the application by visiting http://localhost:5173

Use the admin panel at http://localhost:5173/admin to log in (impersonate) as the admin user "Sendou" or as a regular user "N-ZAP" as well as re-seed the database if needed.

#### Docker

Optionally, if you want to develop image upload, real-time features or chat, you can use Docker to spin up the Skalop service and Minio for image hosting. You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) up and running and then run the following command:

```
docker compose up -d
```

Minio admin UI to manage uploaded photos should be up and running at http://localhost:9001
